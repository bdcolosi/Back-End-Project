##Description:

###This was a back-end development project to demonstrate our full-stack skills. ###The team consisted of three developers and our ###goal was to replicate an ###already exsisting platform to test our understanding of full stack ###development. 

###Many of the features included in this project are similar to Pinterest: user ###login + profile, uploading photos, liking photos ###that save to your profile ###page. The styling of the page is almost identical to the current Pinterest ###layout as well.
